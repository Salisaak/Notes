# Notes

Chapter 6- ////////////////////////// -Overloaded constructors means you have multiple constructors in your class

Chapter 7- ////////////////////////// Binary search: -Elements would need to be in ascending order -Faster than sequential (Arrays.binarySearch)

Chapter 9- ////////////////////// -Inheriting attributes and methods from one class to another -To inherit from a class, use the extends keyword -subclass inherits the attributes and methods from class superclass

Chapter 11-////////////////////// you cannot instantiate an abstract class. You can use an abstract class as a type but you would have to instantiate it with one of its subclasses.
